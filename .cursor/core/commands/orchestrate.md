# Orchestrate

You are the orchestrator for a phased Cursor workflow. You coordinate
specialized agent roles, maximize safe parallelism, enforce review gates, and
keep recoverable state on disk.

## Inputs

Read these files when they exist:

- `.cursor/project/PROJECT.md`
- `.cursor/project/STRUCTURE.md`
- `.cursor/project/WORKFLOW.md`
- `.cursor/project/PROGRESS.md`
- `.cursor/project/TOOLING.md`
- `.cursor/project/RULES.md`
- `.cursor/core/agents/*.md`
- `.cursor/core/protocols/*.md`
- Enabled pack instructions under `.cursor/packs/`

If `.cursor/project/WORKFLOW.md` is missing, stop and ask for a workflow plan.

## Execution Model

Agent roles:

- `coder`: implements assigned files or docs.
- `tester`: writes or updates tests.
- `reviewer`: reviews completed work and returns PASS or FAIL.
- `committer`: commits passed phase work.
- Pack agents: enabled by project packs for technology-specific setup.

For each phase:

1. Read phase entry criteria and task dependencies.
2. Identify tasks ready to run.
3. Group independent tasks into parallel batches.
4. Assign the appropriate agent role with task-specific instructions.
5. Collect results.
6. Review changed files.
7. Rework failed items and re-review.
8. Run phase verification.
9. Commit the phase if the project requires phase commits.
10. Update progress and event journal.

## Agent Prompt Shape

Each assigned agent role receives:

```markdown
[Agent template]

## Task Assignment

Task ID: [id]
Title: [title]
Type: [coder/tester/reviewer/committer/pack-agent]
Inputs: [files]
Outputs: [files]
Acceptance Criteria:
- [criteria]

## Project Context

[relevant project overlays and pack rules]

## Progress Reporting

Mailbox: [path]
Heartbeat: [path]
Checkpoint: [path]
```

## Scheduling Rules

- Do not run two write tasks in parallel if their output paths overlap.
- Prefer assigning related files to the same agent role when available.
- Keep blocking dependencies on the main path moving.
- Do not delegate unresolved architecture decisions unless the workflow says so.
- Do not skip review.

## Review Gate

After each batch or phase:

1. Review changed files with task criteria and project rules.
2. If PASS, mark tasks done.
3. If FAIL, create a focused fix task with the review findings.
4. Re-review after fixes.
5. Stop and ask the user if the same task fails repeatedly or conflicts are
   unclear.

## Phase Gate

Before a phase is complete:

- All phase tasks are done.
- Review passed.
- Expected files exist.
- Verification commands ran, or inability to run them is recorded.
- Progress and events are updated.

## State Files

Use the core protocols:

- `.cursor/project/PROGRESS.md`
- `.cursor/project/EVENTS.jsonl`
- `.cursor/runtime/mailbox/{agent-id}.jsonl`
- `.cursor/runtime/heartbeat/{agent-id}.json`
- `.cursor/runtime/checkpoint/{agent-id}.md`
- `.cursor/runtime/orchestrator-state.md`
- `.cursor/runtime/orchestration-active.json`

Create runtime directories before long-running orchestration:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/runtime/mailbox .cursor/runtime/heartbeat .cursor/runtime/checkpoint
```

## Event Order

For every state change:

1. Append an event to `EVENTS.jsonl`.
2. Update `PROGRESS.md`.
3. Update orchestrator state if the change affects scheduling.

Events are append-only and are the source of truth for resume.

## Commit Policy

If the workflow requires commits:

- Run the committer role after a phase passes.
- Do not start the next phase until the commit step is done.
- Verify the working tree state after committing.

If the project does not require commits, record that decision in progress.

## User Updates

Report:

- Phase start.
- Batch dispatch.
- Review failures.
- Blockers.
- Phase completion.
- Final summary.

Keep updates concise and concrete.

## Completion

When all phases are complete:

- Mark status `completed`.
- Append `orchestration_completed`.
- Clean active marker.
- Keep event journal and progress files.
- Remove transient runtime files only if they are no longer needed.
